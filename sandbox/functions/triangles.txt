Declare a write function called valid_triangle() that takes three real numbers representing the lengths of the 
three sides of a triangle as its arguments, and outputs either true or false, depending on whther those three
lengths are capable of making a triangle.

Note the following rules about triangles:
    A triangle may only have sides with positive lengths
    The sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
