You want to calculate the final score for a team that has just participated in an exciting quidditch match. Building on the code in quidditch.c, implement a function that takes two variables as input  —  an int indicating the number of times the team got the Quaffle through the other team's hoops, and a bool indicating whether or not they caught the snitch -- and returns that team's final score (what would the return type be?).

Recall that each 'goal' in quidditch is worth 10 points, and that catching the snitch is worth 150 points.
