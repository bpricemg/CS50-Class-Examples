The user is solving some basic addition problems, and wants to make sure they got the correct result. The program, verifier.c, promps the user for the three ints: the two they are adding, followed by the result they got. Write a function verify of type bool, that takes in these three ints and returns either true or false, depending on whether or not they solved the problem correctly.
